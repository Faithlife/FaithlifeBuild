# DotNetBuildSettings.ShowSummary property

True if a build summary should be displayed. (Default false.)

```csharp
public bool? ShowSummary { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The build summary repeats any build warnings and errors, which can seem repetitive, especially with minimal verbosity, and can confuse tools that extract and summarize build warnings and errors.
