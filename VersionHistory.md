# Version History

### 5.0.0

* Default to minimal verbosity.
* The `publish` target publishes packages and documentation if no `--trigger` is specified.
* The `restore` target restores local .NET tools via `dotnet tool restore`.
* Now requires locally installed `xmldocmd` to publish documentation.
* Detect current git branch from `GITHUB_REF` in addition to `APPVEYOR_REPO_BRANCH`.
* Get build number from `APPVEYOR_BUILD_NUMBER` or `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`.
* Improve exit code exception.
* Clean all `tools` projects but keep `tools/bin`.

* Don't show call stack for `BuildException`.

### 4.7.1

* Add `DotNetBuildSettings.Verbosity`.

### 4.0.0

* Stop setting the working directory to the grandparent of the script directory. The working directory is now left as-is. Bootstrapper scripts should set the current directory if desired.
